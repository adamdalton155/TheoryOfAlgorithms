<h3>Polynomial Time Complexity (P)</h3>
<hr>

<i><h4>Introduction</h4></i>
<hr>
<p>This project will discuss the polynomial time complexity class in the following ways...</p>
  <ol>
  <li>>What is Time Complexity?</li>
  <li>Measuring Time Complexity</li>
  <li>Worst, Average and Best case scenarios</li>
  <li>NP-Complete Problems also known as Non-Deterministic Polynomial</li>
  <li>Polynomial time complexity</li>
  <li>Applications of polynomial time in the real world</li>
  <li>Turing Machines</li>
  </ol>
  
<i><h4>How to run</h4></i>
<hr>
<p>You can view the notebook on the GitHub repository. The name of the file is <i>polynomial_time.ipynb</i>. If you wish to change values in the code to see how different values can affect the running time, you must make a folder locally on your machine. Then open Command Prompt for Windows devices or the Terminal for MacOS. In there run the command 'git clone https://github.com/adamdalton155/TheoryOfAlgorithms'. Open the folder in your code editior e.g. Visual Studio Code or open on Jupyter Notebook. Also bear in mind, this requires you to have Python installed on your machine. <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"> Follow this link to install Python</a> or if you think you have it installed, open Command Prompt/Terminal and run the command 'python --version' and if you see a version, it is installed.</p>
